							<h2>About me</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Just a 22-year-old Canadian girl that's always got her nose stuck in a book. I'm a huge fan of the Vancouver Canucks. I also have a bit of a soft spot for the Toronto Maple Leafs. I'm a dirt biker that loves camping and sitting by the campfire, staring up into the stars. I'm a reader. I read books as much as I can. Some of my favourite books include: every single book Sarah J. Maas, Sabaa Tahir, and Tahereh Mafi have written. Also a big fan of JK Rowling and the AMAZING Harry Potter series. And I'm still waiting for that day when someone comes out with a candle that smells like the pages of an old book. I also LOVE to write. </p>

							<h2>Until  I Met You</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>After violating campus rules and committing student misconduct, twenty-three-year-old Warren Ashford is deep trouble and at risk of losing his volleyball scholarship -- the one thing he truly values other than his bad boy reputation, and his family. There's only one way Warren can salvage the scholarship that's giving him a free ride through university and that involved keeping his lifestyle low-key. Meaning, no partying at clubs on Friday nights and no late-night hookups with random girls. No fun. Just him, his education, and volleyball. Oh -- and the high-strung, sassy girl with the deepest brown eyes he's ever seen.</p>

						<div class="content">
							<p>Emyln Walker and Hainsey Stone have been best friends since grade five, but just after their relationship takes a big step, Emyln's parents divorce and she's moving to a different city, leaving Hainsey alone in the beautiful city of Whistler, BC. Five years later, Emyln returns to Whistler to meet her new family of strangers: a mom she hasn't seen in five years, a stepdad, and two stepsiblings. She's not particularly excited about the idea, but a strong tie from her past has enough of a hold to make her stay.</p>

							<h2>Bending The Rules</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Brenna Harrison has direction, ambition, and a single mother who is intent on giving her the best life she could possibly have. She also has mad skills when it comes to hockey. Being the only girl to play in the league has given her a reputation that makes the other boys respect (and sometimes hate) her. She's tough and determined and won't let anything stop her from playing the sport she loves. The only person that can seem to get under her skin is Shea Smith -- the boy who has been her sworn enemy since kindergarten.</p>

						<div class="content">
							<p>Seventeen-year-olds Mirabel Johansen and Breton Levesque are ready for their senior year of high school -- the parties, graduation, hanging out with their friends, but more importantly, their relationship. Already a month into their senior year, the two of them have gone on a camping trip with their friends and families for October Long Weekend. Everything has been going great so far; the weekend has been full of dirt biking and quading, s'mores, singing songs by the campfire, and spending time with everyone and each other. </p>

						<div class="content">
							<p>Not all storms come to disrupt your life, some come to clear your path. Those are the words that Justin McCallister has been repeating in his mind since the day he was diagnosed with a non-cancerous brain tumour that's been causing partial seizures for the past five years of his life. Partial seizures that can't seem to be controlled by every epileptic medication he takes. It's caused him to push everyone away. </p>

Still suffering from the memories and aftermath, Kinsley wants nothing more than to leave her past behind. Armed with one plane ticket and the money post-secondary education money her parents left behind, Kinsley escapes Winnipeg to start over at the University of Calgary.</p>
