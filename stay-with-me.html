              <p>Not all storms come to disrupt your life, some come to clear your path. </p>

              <p>Those are the words that Justin McCallister has been repeating in his mind since the day he was diagnosed with a non-cancerous brain tumour that's been causing partial seizures for the past five years of his life. Partial seizures that can't seem to be controlled by every epileptic medication he takes. It's caused him to push everyone away. He refuses to become friends with anyone because he knows, from personal experience, that they're eventually going to leave him behind due to his circumstances. He knows that no matter where someone stands in your life, be it family members or friends, they will find a way to stab you in the back. And after experiencing the divorce and complicated situation his parents went through, he's determined to avoid girls because he believes love is foolish and volatile. </p>

              <p>Bring Adelaide "Addie" Levesque into the picture. She's a smart, beautiful girl that has a strong sense of direction, knows where she belongs, and wishes that she could have an epic love story like the one her parents share. But beneath her confidence, she's scared. She doesn't know what she wants to do after high school and it scares her. On top of that, none of the boys can't seem to understand her for who she is. </p>

              <p>Everything changes when they meet. </p>

              <p>Addie finds the situation to be painfully cliche, but she can't help but be curious about the new boy in her class. She wants to know why he keeps his hood up and earbuds in during lectures. </p>

              <p>Justin knows he should stay away from her, but there's something about her that begs for his attention. She's sweet and charming, but the problem is, he doesn't want to delve deep into his past with her. He doesn't want to reveal the ugly truth about who he is beneath the act.</p>

              <p>As Justin and Addie go through their final year of high school, the realize you never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have.</p>
