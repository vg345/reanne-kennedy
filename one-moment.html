              <p>Broken and hard-shelled twenty-two-year-old Kinsley Hastings wants out. After being the only person to survive a fatal car crash, losing her family, boyfriend, and best friend, she refuses to become attached to anything or anyone. Still suffering from the memories and aftermath, Kinsley wants nothing more than to leave her past behind. Armed with one plane ticket and the money post-secondary education money her parents left behind, Kinsley escapes Winnipeg to start over at the University of Calgary. She's determined to get through school and live the life everyone who loved her would want her to live. After facing the horrible aspects of life, she can handle anything. Except for the mysterious rising country star she meets at a campus pub the night she arrives. </p>

              <p>Noel McLean has feisty brown eyes, dimples that would make any girl swoon, and a voice that's as smooth as the finest whisky. He's irresistible -- and not just because of his looks. He's sweet and funny and knows how to treat a girl properly. Bonus: he's pursuing a long-time dream of becoming a country star. </p>

              <p>Hardened by her troubled, tragic past, Kinsley is determined to keep him away. But little does she know that Noel is facing demons just as bad as her tragic past. And with the sudden mutual attraction that begins to build between them, Noel is desperate to find a way to break Kinsley's defensive attitude -- even if it means revealing a secret that could shatter both their worlds.</p>
