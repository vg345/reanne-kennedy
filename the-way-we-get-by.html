              <p>Best friends.</p>
              <p>Neighbours.</p>
              <p>And a spark that can't be ignored...</p>

              <p>Emyln Walker and Hainsey Stone have been best friends since grade five, but just after their relationship takes a big step, Emyln's parents divorce and she's moving to a different city, leaving Hainsey alone in the beautiful city of Whistler, BC. </p>

              <p>Five years later, Emyln returns to Whistler to meet her new family of strangers: a mom she hasn't seen in five years, a stepdad, and two stepsiblings. She's not particularly excited about the idea, but a strong tie from her past has enough of a hold to make her stay.</p>

              <p>The last thing Hainsey needs is Emyln turning up, bringing old memories with her and opening old wounds. But Emyln -- even better looking than Hainsey remembers -- seems determined to rekindle what she left behind; revive their friendship no matter how much Hainsey tries to push her away. </p>

              <p>Since her departure, he's been facing demons of his own. With a dad that walked out with another woman, and a mom that's a heroin addict, Hainsey has been struggling to keep his head above water for the past five years. Working two jobs,  he barely makes enough money to pay the bills, let alone be the one who has to retrieve and pay for the drugs in order to keep his mom happy. Hainsey is playing a dangerous game that he doesn't want Emyln, his childhood best friend -- and sweetheart -- to know about.</p>

              <p>Forced to work together over the summer, Hainsey can't help but start falling for Emyln, and soon they're in the midst of a passionate romance that neither of them wants to end.  </p>

              <p>But both Hainsey and Emyln know that if they want this relationship to last, they need to confront the past and the present -- both containing events and decisions that they want to stay buried.</p>
